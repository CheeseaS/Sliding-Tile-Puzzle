The UI specifications:

For both Modes:

1. two buttons to select math mode vs. number mode
2. a board of 5x5 tiles
3. one blank tile at the bottom right of the board
4. allow dragging of the small tiles
5. a timer
6. an exit/stop button

Additional for Math Mode:

1. a screen where new players register their names and old players enter their names
2. a button to see the top five scores
3. two buttons to select single player mode vs. two player mode:
	if two player-mode is selected:
		two buttons to choose between basic and cutthroat modes.

Math Mode requirements:

1. an algorithm to generate a solvable puzzle (with numbers and binary operators)
2.Validate the userâ€™s formulated output (after the timer ends I think)
3. Storing the top five scores with their names in a small database
4. comparing the new score with the stored ones:
	Notify players when they have reached a new high score
5. Build the connection between two connected devices on the same network (extra: I think it would be great if we can host the game on an on line server as well)
6. same timer should be displayed for the two players 
7. For the Basic mode, we should show the scores of each at the end of the game
8. For the cutthroat mode: we need to synchronize between the two devices to prevent any repetitions of equations.
9. allow multiple rounds for the two players mode and store who wins each round with the associated score.
 
Number Mode requirements:

1. an algorithm to generate a solvable puzzle (with numbers 1-24)
2. an algorithm to order the tiles
